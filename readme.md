[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Cat):

> I Am a Cat (Japanese: 吾輩は猫である Hepburn: Wagahai wa Neko de Aru) is a satirical novel written in 1905–1906 by Natsume Sōseki, about Japanese society during the Meiji period (1868–1912); particularly, the uneasy mix of Western culture and Japanese traditions, and the aping of Western customs.

### Sources

The [Japanese text](http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000148/files/789_14547.html) used is from Aozora Bunko and contains glosses that clarify the reading.

The [English text](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Cat), translated in 1918 by Yasotarō Mōri, is from anyreads.net.

The original work by Sōseki is in the public domain in both Japan and the United States, and as far as I know both the above sources are also public domain versions of the text.

### Pull Requests

I don't intend to make spelling or grammatical changes unless perhaps something is quite obviously nonsense, but smaller fixes/improvements (e.g. rectifying errors or inconsistencies in formatting, removing extra spaces, removing occurences of \*\* in the middle of words, etc.) are welcome.
